#search in an inifinite sorted array

#TimeComplexity : O(log n)
#solution accepted
# the way to solve this probelm is to keep the fact in mind that the target is always within the high and low of a binary search
#we move the left to the previous right bound while parsing the loop,# then perform the binary search,
