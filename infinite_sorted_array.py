# Problem - Search in Infinite sorted array
    - (https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-a-sorted-array-of-unknown-size/)
    - Given a sorted array of unknown length and a number to search for,
    return the index of the number in the array.
    - Accessing an element out of bounds throws exception.
    - If the number occurs multiple times, return the index of any occurrence.
    - If it isnâ€™t present, return -1.
Solution - Recursive approach
    - Define search boundaries
    - Perform Binary Search
Time Complexity - O(log n), where n is the index of target value
Space Complexity - O(1)
// Did this code successfully run on Leetcode : Yes
// Any problem you faced while coding this : No
