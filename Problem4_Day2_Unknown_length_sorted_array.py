// Time Complexity : O(log n) where n is the index.
// Space Complexity : O(1) constant time complexity
// Did this code successfully run on Leetcode : Yes
// Any problem you faced while coding this : I had to resolve a couple of errors with the raise exception part.


// Your code here along with comments explaining your approach: As we are restricted from finding the length, boundries were defined 
with left index as zero and right index as one. The mid-value was calculated with additional complexity to handle integer overflow 
situation. If the mid-value of index fetches the target value, the same is returned. Else, we adjust the boundaries to right or left 
depending on whether the target value is greator than or lesser than the mid-value.

        while left < right:
            middle = left + (right-left) // 2   # handles integer overflow problem
            
            if middle >= maxValue:
