Problem 3
702. Search in a Sorted Array of Unknown Size

Time Complexity : O(logN)
 
Space Complexity : O(1)

    
We are trying to move the search space in a way that 
low is moved 1st step
High with 2*High
Loop Until we find the target greated than high element position

Then Mid is found and applying Binary Search
