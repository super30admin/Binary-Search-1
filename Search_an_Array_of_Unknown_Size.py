# Given an integer array sorted in ascending order, write a function to search target in nums. If target exists, then return its index,
# otherwise return -1. However, the array size is unknown to you.
# You may only access the array using an ArrayReader interface, where ArrayReader.get(k) returns the element of the array at index k (0-indexed).
# You may assume all integers in the array are less than 10000, and if you access the array out of bounds, ArrayReader.get will return 2147483647.
