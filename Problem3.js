/*Search in Infinite sorted array:

https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-a-sorted-array-of-unknown-size/

Given a sorted array of unknown length and a number to search for, return the index of the 
number in the array. Accessing an element out of bounds throws exception. If the 
number occurs multiple times, return the index of any occurrence. If it isnâ€™t present, return -1.*/
