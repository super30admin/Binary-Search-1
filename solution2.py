# Search in Infinite sorted array:
# Given a sorted array of unknown length and a number to search for,
# return the index of the number in the array. Accessing an element out of bounds throws exception.
# If the number occurs multiple times, return the index of any occurrence. If it isnâ€™t present, return -1.

# // Time Complexity : logn+logn == logn
