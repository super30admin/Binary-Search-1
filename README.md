# Binary-Search-1

## Problem1 
Search a 2D Matrix(https://leetcode.com/problems/search-a-2d-matrix/)
- Time Complexity : m+log(n) (number of rows + binerary seacrh on the row where target could be found) 
-  Space Complexity : O(1)
-  Did this code successfully run on Leetcode : yes
-  Any problem you faced while coding this : No

## Problem1 
Search in a Rotated Sorted Array (https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array/)
-  Time Complexity : O(log n)
-  Space Complexity : O 1
-  Did this code successfully run on Leetcode : Yes
-  Any problem you faced while coding this : yes
- I could not get the code working for the right hand side sorted array. Got it after doing dry run on paper

## Problem2
Search in Infinite sorted array: https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-a-sorted-array-of-unknown-size/
Given a sorted array of unknown length and a number to search for, return the index of the number in the array. Accessing an element out of bounds throws exception. If the number occurs multiple times, return the index of any occurrence. If it isnâ€™t present, return -1.
-  Time Complexity : O(log n)
-  Space Complexity : O(1)
-  Did this code successfully run on Leetcode : yes
-  Any problem you faced while coding this : NA
