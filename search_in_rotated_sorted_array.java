// Time Complexity : O(logn)
// Space Complexity : O(1)
// Did this code successfully run on Leetcode : Yes
// Any problem you faced while coding this : Yes, I was able to get which part of array to disregard but to find whether selected space it is sorted or not was missing and it 
//got cleared after the class
