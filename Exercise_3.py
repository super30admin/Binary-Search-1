'''Used binary search, multiplying left and right indices by two, to find the range target
falls under. Then, use binary search to search through the range.

# Problem: Given a sorted array of unknown length and a number to search for, return the 
# index of the number in the array. Accessing an element out of bounds throws exception. 
# If the number occurs multiple times, return the index of any occurrence. If it isnâ€™t 
# present, return -1.
