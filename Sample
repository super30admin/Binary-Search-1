# // Your code here along with comments explaining your approach in three sentences only
# By creating loop over the columns running columns to row which will time complexity O(log (m*n)).

# Problem 2

# // Time Complexity :
# // Space Complexity :
# // Did this code successfully run on Leetcode : Yes
# // Any problem you faced while coding this :
#Got logic after attending lecture and implemented in leet code


# // Your code here along with comments explaining your approach in three sentences only
# By using approach of binary search , using mid element, check mid element is target, left side with target then right side.
