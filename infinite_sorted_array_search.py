# Time Complexity : log(n)

# Did this code successfully run on Leetcode : No, Premium is Required
# Any problem you faced while coding this : Yes, don't know how to handle array out of bound exception

# Approach: Take two pointers, at consecutive positions from start and check for the range in which the target exists
# by rapidly increasing the search space by doubling the high pointer
