// Your code here along with comments explaining your approach
//we need to find the lower and higher bound
//first approach, low = 0 and high = 10^4, then we can do binary search, but we want to go better high bound
//second approach, low = 0 and high = 1, we will multiply higher bound by 2 till value at higher bound is greater than target

    int low = 0;
    int high = 1;

    //low = 0 and high = 1, we will multiply higher bound by 2 till value at higher bound is greater than target
    //complexityof this is O(logn) because we are multiplying by 2
    //we can multiply ofby 3, 4 or 5, we will increase space complexity also.
    //we also set low = high, so that our search window would be narrow for better TC
    while(reader.get(high) < target)

        low = high;
