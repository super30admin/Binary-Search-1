Your code here along with comments explaining your approach
1) we find the middle element using binary search. Then determine if left half of right half is sorted.
2)If left half is sorted then check if the target lies within the left half range. If the target lies then high = mid-1
else low = mid +1
3) Do the same thing if the right half is sorted.
