Problem: Given a sorted array of unknown length and a number to search for, return the index of the number in the array.
    Accessing an element out of bounds throws exception. If the number occurs multiple times, return the index of any occurrence.
    If it isnâ€™t present, return -1.
Approach: Using binary search to find the target in a sub array whose bounds are determined in chunks. The lower bound starts with 0th
    index and increments as high. The higher bound starts with 1st index in the array and increments as twice of its current value.
    The sub array is then subject to normal binary search with newer calculated bounds.
Time Complexity: O(logn) where n is number of elements in the array.
Space complexity: O(1) constant
