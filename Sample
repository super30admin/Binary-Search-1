Q1)
// Time Complexity : O(Max(log m, lon n)) where m is the size high goes until we find the target and n is the size when we found the bound so log n is binary search in this size. 
// Space Complexity : O(n)
// Did this code successfully run on Leetcode : Yes
// Any problem you faced while coding this : yes I was not updating low.
